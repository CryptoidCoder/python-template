
## Prerequests:
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## How To Format `.env` file:
- Create a file called `.env`
- In it should be the following:

- In between the ' ' you need to add your own token
```

Token1 = 'TOKEN1_HERE'
Token2 = 'TOKEN2_HERE'


```

### To Do Thing1:
- `python file1.py --arg1:thing --arg2:thing1/thing2`
- You need to have `--arg1:` or `--arg2:` before an argument
- The first argument is to *do this thing*
- If you use `thing1` for your second argument - it will do `thing1`
- If you use `thing2` for your second argument - it will do `thing2`
